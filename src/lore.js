      We are the Laughing Hyenas of the Savannah roaming the plain doing what we please. Others laugh to hide the pain, the shame, the sadness but not us, we simply laugh cause life is a joke. It is a cruel world, and everything is a joke in the eye of the beholder. No matter where we come from each of us is unique but shares the same mentality and that is what pushes us each day. This mentality is that of bandits doing what we please and this is the road warrior mentality. We are a force to be reckoned with and we carry that with a chip on our shoulder.

      We have no home and roam where we please across the Savannah in search for adventure because that is what life is.

This is a story about five individuals who found themselves involved with the greatest clan known to earth. This is the tale of five hyenas and their unique story and how fate led them to each other.
<br/>
<br/>
To start this story, we must start with the mastermind behind it all,  Kendez. Raised in captivity his first thought he can remember is the crate that he came in. He was forced into a zoo against his will to be looked at by on goers without a care for his true potential. Trapped with nothing and lost within his own thoughts. All that was left was a hole in his heart that he could not fill. This desire to fill this void all became too much for him and it started to consume his life. He decided that it was time for a change and went off into the mountains. This was not an easy task though and spent years planning for his big break. The plan was after his last feeding time, there would be a window to allow for him to be able to crawl through the sewage when no one was around. He ran and never looked back until out of breath, hungry, and thirsty. That is when he looked up. Here in this moment, he fell in love with the stars and long for nothing but the freedom to do his own bidding. He discovered his own self-worth and decided what was the point of rolling over as far as he had come. He started to ponder his life and started to reflect on how he even ended up in the zoo in the first place and how he came to be. So many questions and no answers were enough to drive him insane. This insanity helped to spark a fire in his soul, and it was at that moment he looked at the moon with a new look that reflected what his soul was yearning for. The next day he established that his next step would be to find the answers to all his questions. After years of working on himself, it was clear to see that there was only one answer to this madness and that was to go back to the hell that he had come from. Here lies all the answers to his questions. With a level head he was off to start his new journey without an ounce of fear. If someone were to look upon him at that very moment, they would find a smile on his face that showed all his teeth and an expression that warned others to mind their own business.Upon reaching his destination, there was a sudden urge to go back to the cage that he had lived in. In the dead of night through the same means he had escaped the first time, there he was all alone. Working his way through he couldn’t help but hear a laugh that seemed to pierce the night. Intrigued, he decided to investigate and what he found shocked him. Upon entering he was amazed at all the beautiful artwork on the walls as well as on the ground. He realized that this was a skill worthy of freedom. For the first time he was standing face to face with another of his kind. Trapped just like he was, he couldn't help but feel moved.  Freedom should be for everyone and not just him. This was the needed opportunity to gather more information and find out what really went down all those years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
The hyena that Kendez encountered went by the name of Kochart. Born and raised in captivity, he knew nothing of the outside world but this did not stop his creativity. He had a look that showed the hunger within him and a longing for something more. Taken at a young age, Kochart knew he had a gift for creating/drawing ever since he was little. Everyday he would get bags of various fruits and would eat only half of it. With the rest of the fruit he would find himself smashing and utilizing the juice to create masterpieces that left the guards speechless. Slowly over time his cage ran out of space to draw and he sadly could draw no more. It was here that he hungered for more and realized that a talent like his should not be hidden. Unfortunately he had no chance due to the tight security that operated the zoo. That was until he heard a grinding noise that awoke him from his slumber. The moon shone bright down upon him to reveal a fur like his creeping out of the shadows.
<br/>
<br/>
 Deeply moved by the look in KoChart’s eyes,  this was all Kendez needed. Rather than escaping the way he had, Kochart had another idea in mind. He talked about how he noticed the guards protecting something in the back of the zoo and at night would hear loud noises that sounded like the roar of an engine. They both went to investigate but decided to go through the back entrance to avoid any guards that may still be around. Kochart noted how there was an increase in the shipment of animals coming in and how animals would leave without a trace. Unknown to them but this zoo was not like any other and was heavily involved with the black market and the shipping of exoctic animals under the radar. As both hyenas were snooping around in the back, Kochart noticed that the tiles on the ground did not line up. Using his strength, he pawed the ground and revealed a hidden door with a ladder leading to the basement. Upon entering the basement they found themselves in a room with control panels and a hologram map of the world in the middle.To the left they could see a hangar full of vehicles and cages.  Suddenly the room lit with red lights and an alarm that made a deafening noise. Both hyenas could hear the noise of guards approaching knowing that if they were caught they would lose all hopes of  freedom. Scrambling around Kendez noticed two red buttons. Without hesitation he ran over to them and pressed them. The ground started to shake beneath their paws as the ceiling opened to reveal the night sky and the stars. Coming up from the ground in the hangar, was not just a ship but a mini rocket ship. This new discovery was quickly interrupted by the pounding and shuffling of guards; they were trapped. Not willing to give up, Kochart spotted a green button out of the corner of his eyes that had coordinates projected above it. Without hesitation, he pressed the button and over the speaker a countdown commenced and the engines to the rocket ignited. The two hyenas dashed to the hangar and climbed in not knowing where they were going or what would happen to them but all they knew was that freedom lay ahead of them and all they could do was strap in and enjoy the ride.
 <br/>
 <br/>
In the midst of this chaos, there was another story being formed with one hyena who had enough of the life he was living. This hyena goes by the name of Kekmaan and was a force to be reckoned with. This hyena was trapped in not a cage but rather a lifestyle. Taken at a young age away from his home by wealthy poachers. He was forced into a life of being on display for others to see all the while chained up. Never being able to express himself and given no freedom there was a flame deep down. The flame that was growing inside him, was growing more and more after each new onlooker. There was a steady hunger and a call that reached back all the way to his ancestors. One day he accepted that enough was enough and that the only way to break out of his chains to obtain the freedom he desired was to make his own opportunity for his great escape. He realized that the chain he was tied to was loose at the base and that if he lunged his body that it would move ever so slightly. Everyday when no one was around he would lunge and lunge until his neck was raw but he never stopped. He knew that the pain he was feeling was only temporary compared to his goals and desires. Finally his efforts were rewarded when it was loose enough that one last lunge would be enough. With all his might he gave a final lunge that allowed for the chain to finally give way, he was free. The feeling was short lived because the noise had echoed through the night waking his captors. Now it was crunch time knowing that he would be shot on site without hesitation. He immediately bolted towards the exit only to see a poacher standing in his way with a club meant to cause harm. There was no hesitation and no fear but pure straight adrenaline pumping through Kekmaan’s whole body. Kekmaan knew that it was either him or his enemy. Like a bolt of lightning he quickly made a side step and then lunged his teeth into the man’s flesh. The taste of blood brought back memories of his ancestors that flooded into his mind awakening his inner savage. He knew that he could not waste any time and that his best bet would be to make a beeline outside of the property and into the dead of night. It was no good though because there was a fence preventing him from escaping. Panic slowly started to creep up but it was immediately squashed realizing that there was no time. He looked in the distance and saw a man on a bike pulling behind him a wagon full of spices and food. He sprinted over to the man without being noticed and quickly hopped into the wagon and laid amongst the barrels concealing himself allowing for him to get through the gates undetected. He had made it, he was finally free as he laid in the wagon. After all the adrenaline, he felt his eyes start to get heavy and allowed for himself to fall into a deep slumber. Kekmaan awoke from his slumber to find himself in a savanna with the heat of the sun hitting his fur. The man pulling the wagon in the bike turned out to be a traveling man going from place to place selling his goods. Kekmaan thought there was no harm and stayed in the wagon allowing for his legs to have the needed rest. Suddenly he heard a boom in the sky and looked to see a metal object making its way towards his direction. He immediately ditched the wagon and hopped out just in time to avoid getting crushed by a metal rocket.  It was at this time that Kendez and Kochart emerged from the rocket. The rocket had run out of gas and crash landed in the middle of the savannah. Stunned to see two hyenas, Kekmaan went to investigate and realized that though they were different they all shared something in common. Once the three got acquainted it was evident that neither of them had had any food in their system. This is when they lifted their noses to the sky to pick up the scent of blood. They immediately followed it back to the source and what they saw shocked the hyenas. Surrounded by five lions they noticed a fresh kill being guarded by a single hyena with a look that could pierce a stone .
<br/>
<br/>
Ever since he could remember Kount was alone, forced to fend for himself as he aimlessly wandered from place to place. He learned at a young age that in this life it was kill or be killed. He learned how to adapt to his surroundings and how to take care of himself. He lived with a lone wolf mentality that kept him motivated day in and day out. This soon bred a resilience and hatred for weakness and knew that only the fittest would survive. Yet despite all his adversity he never allowed for himself to be down and out. He took everything with a grain of salt and saw the world through the lens of the glass being half full. He knew that it did not matter where you came from or what you have been through because at the end of the day no one cares. All that matter was the right now and to focus his attention on making it through the day in hopes of seeing a better tomorrow. This mentality allowed him to dig down deep and find the drive to not give up no matter how hopeless the situation he found himself in. He knew that as long as he smiled and laughed no matter the situation, the outcome would always end up in his favor. After being hungry for two days, he was finally able to find an injured water buffalo and took it down himself. His mouth watering at the chance to be able to taste the meat and eliminate his hunger. As he was fixing to take his first bite he heard a growling noise. He immediately looked up to find six lions staring at him, inching closer and closer to the fresh kill he had just made. Smiling and laughing, he took a bite from the kill that signified that he was going nowhere. At the site of this one lion decided to creep up to take a bite himself to establish alpha male dominance. This was a big mistake because his guard was down allowing for Kount to leap and strike at the lion’s jugular connecting with a blow,  as the fangs pierced through the lion's skin. Kount could feel the life of the lion slowly leaving the lion’s body until the lion was limp and motionless. Enraged by their comrades death the lion’s let out a roar that reflected the anger, hunger, and pain they felt. Kount couldn't care less and smiled as he still held on to the lion’s neck while laughing in the most sinister way. Observing behind a rock Kendez, Kochart, and Kekmaan watched as each of the five lions took turns nipping and scratching the lone hyena, desperately fending off his kill. The lone hyena was exhausted, badly injured, and about at his end yet still managed to remain standing. Fed up and realizing enough was enough, without a word each hyena sprinted towards the hyena to the surprise of the five lions. Still outnumbered it was evident that it was kill or be killed and there was no turning back. Being essentially a hyena down, it was a five vs three fight with the odds stacked against them. The battle lasted hours with each party going back and forth. As soon as one party would start to get the edge, the other would respond with their own counter attack. Exhausted, thirsty, and hungry the hyenas were out of breath and it was evident that the tide was turned against them. That was until, out of the tall grass, a hyena leaped and stuck its teeth right into a lion’s backside. This surprise attack from the back allowed for the three hyenas an opportunity to go on the offensive. Realizing that enough was enough,  the five lions immediately started retreat and ran away with Kendez, Kochart, Kekmaan, Kount, and this new hyena nipping at their heels ensuring they would never return. It was at this moment that Kount, weak and weary collapsed to the ground with all the energy depleted in him. It was evident that treatment was needed and that the longer they stayed out in the open the more susceptible they were to another attack. The new hyena introduced himself as Atlas Kingsman and stated that there was an old rundown temple where they would be safe.
<br/>
<br/>
If there was a definition of an individual whose actions spoke louder than words, Atlas Kingsman would be a prime candidate. Having a relatively ordinary life growing up, he found himself in a clan surrounded by other hyenas. Starting from the bottom, he slowly worked his way through the ranks and established himself as being able to not only handle any task given to him but would help others along the way as well. This led to him being held in high regard by his peers and allowed for him to eventually be put second in charge of the clan itself. Humbled yet hungry there was a passion that yearned within him to be better than he was yesterday. A constant struggle to never be satisfied. The clan consisted of fifteen hyenas all loyal to him but very soon tragedy had befallen his comrades. It was necessary that finding a new place to house their own was a top priority. Some miles away there was a rundown temple that fit the bill as the perfect place to set up their new operations. Only problem was that the journey was going to be no easy task. Bad luck befell the clan and slowly their numbers started to dwindle. The trail they were on would oftentimes find themselves having to cross dangerous areas where one wrong move could mean the end to one’s life. From having to cross narrow fallen trees over fast rapid waters to walking through the marshlands where snakes and crocodiles waited in hopes of claiming their next meal. By the time they had gotten out of the marshlands only ten hyenas remained. Stricken by grief Atlas Kingsman knew that they had to continue on their journey and put on a brave face. Their troubles did not end for they were constantly being followed from apex predators, whether that be from lions, jaguars, african dogs, to other hyenas. They experienced nothing but surprise attacks with their only option at times were to run for their lives to safety. One attack was the final blow and it occurred within the dead of night. Given no chance or opportunity to fend for themselves, a rival clan of hyenas came and started to pick off each and last one of the hyenas who at the time were fast asleep. Witnessing the carnage it was all too much for Atlas Kingsman and a switch went off that awoken his inner savage as he started to kill one hyena after another. When the sun started to rise all that could be seen amongst the blood and the bodies was one hyena covered in blood smiling and laughing. After walking and finding a watering hole, he rinsed off the blood and heard laughing and roaring off in the distance. He snuck through the tall grass to find a battle raging between four hyenas nearing their end and five powerful lions. With the memories of his fallen comrades still fresh in his mind, he could not watch anymore and decided to take action by sneaking behind the lions and leaping at the closest one to him. All he was thinking about at that moment was that if he were to die, it would be through fighting and nothing else.
<br/>
<br/>
The five hyenas as they were walking to this temple that was talked of, discussed and shared amongst themselves their origins and where they came from. This started to create and form a bond amongst the group to the point where they were acting as if they had known each other all their lives. Worn out and tired they all finally reached their  destination and walked up the steps to see for themselves their new home. Before entering they all came together to form a clan that was unlike any other with each individual being able to hold their own. Once this was finished, they continued up the steps to the temple laughing and smiling knowing that even though they had all encountered the shadow of death, they had nothing to fear. For they were the baddest and most savage hyenas in all of the savannah. A true force to be reckoned with.</div>
